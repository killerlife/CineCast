<h1>Contributing to XML-Security</h1>
    
<a name="N1000D"></a><a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Introduction</h2>
<div class="section">
<p> 
	The XML Security Project is an 
	<a class="external" href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> 
        volunteer project released
	under a very open license. This means there are many ways to contribute to the
	project - either with direct participation (coding, documenting, answering
	questions, proposing ideas, reporting bugs, suggesting bug-fixes, etc..) or by
	resource donations (money, time, publicity, hardware, software, conference
	presentations, speeches, etc...). 
      </p>
<p> 
	To begin with, we suggest you to subscribe to the
        <a href="mail-lists.html">XML-Security mailing list</a> (follow the link for
	information on how to subscribe and to access the mail list archives).
	Listen-in for a while, to hear how others make contributions. 
      </p>
<p>
	You can get your local working copy of the
        <a class="external" href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-security">latest and
	  greatest code</a> (which you find in the xml-security module in the CVS code
	repository. Review the todo list, choose a task (or perhaps you have noticed
	something that needs patching). Make the changes, do the testing, generate a
	patch, and post to the dev mailing list. (Do not worry - the process is easy
	and explained below.) 
      </p>
</div>
    
<a name="N10029"></a><a name="Help+Wanted+Here"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Help Wanted Here</h2>
<div class="section">
<p> 
	The rest of this document is mainly about contributing new or
        improved code and/or documentation, but we would also be glad to have extra
        help in any of the following areas: 
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>
	  Answering questions on the mailing list - there
          is often a problem of having too many questioners and not enough experts to
          respond to all the questions.
	</li>
        
<li>
	  Testing the package (especially its less-frequently-used features) on
          various configurations and reporting back.
	</li>
        
<li>
	  Debugging - producing reproduceable test cases and/or finding
          causes of bugs. Some known bugs are informally listed on To Do, and some are
          recorded in Bugzilla (see <a href="#procedure">explanation
	    below</a>).
	</li>
      
<li>
	  Specifying/analysing/designing new features - and beyond. (If you
	  wish to get involved with this, please join the mailing list, install
	  and try out xml-security and read some of the 
	  <a href="mail-lists.html">mail archives</a>. You should have a strong
          "fluency" in XML technologies especially XMLDSig and XML Encryption,
	  Java or C++ and a basic understanding of the architecture of this
	  package.

<h2 class="h3">CVS Usage Precis</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
	An overview of how to use CVS to participate in the XML Security development.
        Do not be afraid - you cannot accidently destroy the actual code repository,
        because you are working with a local copy as an anonymous user. Therefore, you
        do not have the system permissions to change anything. You can only update your
        local repository and compare your revisions with the real repository. 
      </p>
<p> 
	(Further general CVS usage information is at
        <a class="external" href="http://www.cvshome.org/">www.cvshome.org</a> and your local
	<span class="codefrag">info cvs</span> pages or <span class="codefrag">man cvs</span> pages or user
	documentation.) 
      </p>
<p> 
	Have a look at the <a href="Java/installation.html">Java</a> or
	<a href="c/installation.html">C++</a> installation pages to see
	how to get a local copy of the source.

<p>
	After a developer has consistently provided contributions (code,
        documentation and discussion), then the rest of the dev community may vote to
        grant this developer commit access to CVS. 
      </p>
<p>
	You will need secure access to the repository to be able to commit
        patches. Here are some resources that help to get your machine configured to
        use the repository over SSH.

    <a name="N1008F"></a><a name="Procedure+for+Raising+Development+Issues"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Procedure for Raising Development Issues</h2>
<div class="section">
<p> 
	There are two methods for discussing development and submitting
        patches. So that everyone can be productive, it is important to know which
        method is appropriate for a certain situation and how to go about it without
        confusion. This section explains when to use the <span class="codefrag">developer</span>
        <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing list</a> the bug database. 
      </p>
<p> 
	Research your topic thoroughly before beginning to discuss a new
        development issue. Search and browse through the email archives - your issue
        may have been discussed before. Prepare your post clearly and
	concisely. 
      </p>
<p> 
	Most issues will be discovered, resolved, and then patched quickly
        via the <span class="codefrag">developer</span> mailing list. Larger issues, and ones that are
        not yet fully understood or are hard to solve, are destined for
	Bugzilla. 
      </p>
<p> 
	Experienced developers use Bugzilla directly, as they are very sure
        when they have found a bug and when not. However, less experienced users should
        first discuss it on the user or developer mailing list (as appropriate).
        Impatient people always enter everything into Bugzilla without caring if it is
        a bug of our package or their own installation/configuration mistake - please do
        not do this. 
      </p>
<p> 
	As a rule-of-thumb, discuss an issue on the <span class="codefrag">developers</span>
        mailing list first to work out any details. After it is confirmed to be
        worthwhile, and you are clear about it, then submit the bug description or
        patch via Bug Tracking. 
      </p>
<p> 
	Perhaps you do not get any answer on your first reply, so just post
        it again until you get one. (But please not every hour - allow a few days for
        the list to deal with it.) Do not be impatient - remember that the whole world
        is busy, not just you. Bear in mind that other countries will have holidays at
        different times to your country and that they are in different time zones. You
        might also consider rewriting your initial posting - perhaps it was not clear
        enough and the readers eyes glazed over. 
      </p>

<a name="tips"></a>
    <a name="N100B8"></a><a name="Contribution+Notes+and+Tips"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Contribution Notes and Tips</h2>
<div class="section">
<p> 
	This is a collection of tips for contributing to the project in a
        manner that is productive for all parties. 
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li> 
	  Every contribution is worthwhile. Even if the ensuing discussion
          proves it to be off-beam, then it may jog ideas for other people. 
	</li>
        
<li> 
	  Use sensible and concise email subject headings. Search engines,
          and humans trying to browse a voluminous list, will respond favourably to a
          descriptive title. 
	</li>
        
<li>
	  Start new threads with new Subject for new topics, rather than
          reusing the previous Subject line. 
	</li>
        
<li>
	  Keep each topic focused. If some new topic arises then start a new
          discussion. This leaves the original topic to continue uncluttered. 
	</li>
        
<li>
	  Whenever you decide to start a new topic, then start with a fresh
          new email message window. Do not use the "Reply to" button, because
          threaded mail-readers get confused (they utilise the <span class="codefrag">In-reply-to</span>
          header). If so, then your new topic will get lost in the previous thread and go
          unanswered. 
	</li>
        
<li> 
	  Prepend your email subject line with a marker when that is
          appropriate, e.g. <span class="codefrag">[Patch]</span>, <span class="codefrag">[Proposal]</span>,
          <span class="codefrag">[RT]</span> (Random Thought which quickly blossom into research topics
          :-), <span class="codefrag">[STATUS]</span> (development status of a certain
	  facility). 
	</li>
        
<li> 
	  When making changes to XML documentation, or any XML document for
          that matter, use a <a class="external" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/">validating
	    parser</a> (one that is tried and true is
	  <a class="external" href="http://openjade.sourceforge.net/">OpenSP/onsgmls</a>). This
	  procedure will detect errors without having to go through the whole <span class="codefrag">build
	    docs</span> process to find them. Do not expect Forrest or the build system to
	  detect the validation errors for you - they can do it, but that is not their
	  purpose. (Anyway, nsgmls validation error messages are more
	  informative.) 
	</li>
	
<li> 
	  Remember that most people are participating in development on a
	  volunteer basis and in their "spare time". These enthusiasts will attempt to
	  respond to issues. It may take a little while to get your answers. </li>
	
<li> 
	  Research your topic thoroughly before beginning to discuss a new
	  development issue. Search and browse through the email archives - your issue
	  may have been discussed before. Do not just perceive a problem and then rush
	  out with a question - instead, delve. 
	</li>
	
<li> 
	  Try to at least offer a partial solution and not just a problem
	  statement. 
	</li>
	
<li> 
	  Take the time to clearly explain your issue and write a concise
	  email message. Less confusion facilitates fast and complete
	  resolution. 
	</li>
	
<li> 
	  Do not bother to send an email reply that simply says "thanks". When
	  the issue is resolved, that is the finish - end of thread. Reduce clutter.
        </li>
	
<li> 
	  You would usually do any development work against the HEAD branch of
	  CVS. 
	</li>
	
<li> 
	  When sending a patch, you usually do not need to worry about which
	  CVS branch it should be applied to. The maintainers of the repository will
	  decide. 
	</li>
	
<li> 
	  If an issue starts to get bogged down in list discussion, then it
	  may be appropriate to go into private off-list discussion with a few interested
	  other people. Spare the list from the gory details. Report a summary back to
	  the list to finalise the thread. 
	</li>
	
<li> 
	  Become familiar with the mailing lists. As you browse and search,
	  you will see the way other people do things. Follow the leading
	  examples. 
	</li>
