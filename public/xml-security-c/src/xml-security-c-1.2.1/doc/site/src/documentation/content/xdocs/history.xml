      <title>The &lt;WebSig&gt; project</title>
      <p>
	In mid-1999, the <jump
	  href="http://www.nue.et-inf.uni-siegen.de/">Institute for Data
	  Communications Systems</jump> at the <jump
	  href="http://www.uni-siegen.de/">University of Siegen</jump> in
	Germany looked for partners to participate in a European project for
	implementing the upcoming <jump href="ext:w3c/xmldsig">XML Signature
	  standard</jump>. We found our partners in the companies <jump
	  href="http://www.expnet.gr/">Expertnet S.A.</jump> and <jump
	  href="http://www.proodos.gr/">PROODOS S.A.</jump>, both from Athens,
	who were willing to use our XML Signature library in a first commercial
	project. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The project started in January 2000 and ended up in September 2001. 50%
	of the costs have been funded by the European Commission in the <jump
	  href="http://www.ispo.cec.be/isis/99websig.htm">ISIS
	  programme</jump>. Goal was to develop a JAVA library for creating and
	validating XML Signatures and to make the binaries of this software
	freely available. 
      </p>
      <p>In September 2001, the Institute for Data Communications Systems decided to
	make the sources freely available, too, to promote the use of digital
	signatures and to give XML Signature a spin. The decision was made to
	give the complete library (including an implementation of "Canonical
	XML" and "XML Signature") under the hood of the Apache Software
	Foundation to ensure availablility of the source and to enable other
	people to use it under the Apache License.

      <title>The C++ Library</title>
      <p>The C++ library is a much more recent addition to the XML-Security
        project.  It started out on <jump href="http://www.sourceforge.net">
          Sourceforge</jump> and was migrated into XML Security in early 2003.
