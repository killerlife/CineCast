      <title>XML Signatures</title>
      <p>
	Part of this software can be used to create and verify arbitrary forms
	of XML Signatures. The documentation available here is not very huge;
	my first approach is to supply usage examples which are available in
	the <code>src_samples/</code> directory to give interested users a
	first starting point to jump-start with XML Signature. 
      </p>
      <note>
	The samples divide into two groups: Samples that <em>create</em> and
	samples that <em>verify</em> Signatures. Eventually, you should adjust
	the verifying program to another filename if you get
	<code>FileNotFoundException</code>s.

	  <title>XML Encryption</title>
	  <p>
		As with signatures, samples are provided to show how to encrypt
		and decrypt XML content.  See 
		<code>src_samples/org/apache/xml/security/samples/encryption</code>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The samples can be compiled and run using <code>ant encrypt</code>
		and <code>ant decrypt</code>.
