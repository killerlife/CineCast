      <p>In Version v1.0.4, there is one test case which fails (interop test
	for exclusive c14n). This is related to very esoteric node sets (The Y4
	test vector from 
	<jump
	  href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/02/01-exc-c14n-interop.html">
	  the interop matrix
	</jump>).

      <title>Interoperability issues</title>
      <p>
	As it can be seen on the 
	<jump href="ext:w3c/xmldsig">working group homepage</jump>,
	there are some interoperability reports, namely for 
	<jump href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/2000/10/10-c14n-interop.html">
	  Canonical XML
	</jump>, 
	<jump
	  href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/02/01-exc-c14n-interop.html">
	  Exclusive Canonical XML
	</jump> 
	and 
	<jump
	  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/2001/04/05-xmldsig-interop.html">
	  XML Signature
	</jump>.
      </p>
      <p>
	Interoperability depends heavily on test vectors, this means that
	implementation A has to check whether the signatures from
	implementation B can be verified. For this purpose, we have a
	collection of different test vectors in our <code>data/</code>
	directory. The directory includes test vectors from   
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><jump href="http://www.baltimore.com/keytools/xml/index.html">
	    Baltimore KeyTools XML</jump>
	</li>
	<li><jump href="http://jcewww.iaik.at/products/ixsil/index.php">IAIK IXSIL</jump></li>
	<li><jump
	    href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/products/bsafe/certj.html">
	    RSA Security Cert-J</jump>
	</li>
	<li>The vectors from the 
	  <jump
	    href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlsecuritysuite">
	    IBM alphaWorks XML Security suite
	  </jump> could not been included in this distribution because of
	  licensing issues. For some reasons which I do not understand, they
	  copyrighted their test signatures which they have bundled with
	  xss4j. If you want to include interop testing against IBM in your
	  unit tests, simply do the following:
	  Download <code>xss4j-20030127.zip</code> from the 
	  <jump
	    href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/download/xmlsecuritysuite">
	    alphaWorks download page
	  </jump>. 
	  Copy all files from the <code>xss4j-20030127.zip#/xss4j/data</code>
	  directory into the
	  <code>xml-security/data/com/ibm/xss4j-20030127/</code>
	  directory. If the 
	  <jump href="api/org/apache/xml/security/test/InteropTest.html">
	    Interop
	  </jump> class finds these files, the 
	  <code>org.apache.xml.security.test.interop.IBMTest</code> class is
	  also executed during unit interop tests. 
	</li>
