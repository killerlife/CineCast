	  A lot of resources exist on the web, including the 'green bible' for

    <faq id="env-transf">
      <question>
	What is the enveloped transform?
      </question>
      <answer>
	<p>
	  The enveloped transform is a special transform that enables the use of
	  so-called enveloped signatures.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Enveloped signatures are signatures over an entire XML document, for
	  which the <code>&lt;Signature&gt;</code> element is included in the
	  document itself. An example could be:
	</p>
	<source>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <Root>
     <SomeContent>
       ... 
     </SomeContent>]]><em><![CDATA[
       <ds:Signature>
         <ds:SignedInfo>
           <ds:Reference URI="">
             <ds:Transforms>
               <ds:Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature"/>
             </ds:Transforms>
           </ds:Reference>
         </ds:SignedInfo>
         ....
       </ds:Signature>]]></em><![CDATA[
   </Root>]]>
	</source>
	<p>
	  The <code>Reference</code> indicates that <code>Root</code> and it's
	  descendants (except for comments) are signed, but the
	  <code>Transform</code> element says to throw out the
	  <code>Signature</code> element (that is the parent of this
	  <code>Reference</code>) from the stream that is to be signed. Note
	  that if there are other
	  <code>Signature</code> elements in <code>Root</code>, they will remain
	  untouched.

    <faq id="c14N">
      <question>
	What's the difference between C14N and ExclC14N?
      </question>
      <answer>
	<p>
	  C14N was introduced to solve some problems that arise when signing
	  XML. Because XML allows to change the representation of an XML document
	  without changing the actual content, signatures may break when
	  different parsers are used to generate and verify the signature. A simple
	  example of such an allowed change is changing the order of attributes
	  within an element. (That is solved by C14N by sorting the attributes by
	  alphabet)
	</p>
	<p>
	  Because a C14N'ed XML fragment inherits all the namespace declarations
	  from it's ancestors, it is not possible to embed a signed XML fragment
	  into a document that has other namespace declarations.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This is solved by ExclC14N. ExclC14N takes extra information as input
	  in which you can specify which of the ancestor's namespaces should be
	  included. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  For more information on this topic, have a look at the C14N and
	  ExclC14N sections of the <jump href="site:w3c/xmldsig">W3C XMLDSig WG</jump>.
