      <title>Using JDK 1.4.0</title>
      <p>
	After SUN released the 
	<jump href="ext:java">
	  Java (TM) 2 Platform Standard Edition v1.4.0
	</jump>, the xml-security package stopped working. This is a 
	<jump href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4615582.html">
	  known
	</jump> 
	problem: SUN packaged a beta of Xalan into the JDK 1.4.0, but the
	xml-security package requires a stable version of Xalan (v2.2.0 or
	later). To fix the problem, you have to put the xalan.jar into a
	special directory in your JDK:
	<code>j2sdk1.4.0/jre/lib/endorsed/xalan.jar</code> . If you installed
	an out-of-the-box JDK1.4 (e.g. on Windows 2000), the "endorsed"
	directory does not exist: you'll have to create it by hand. 
      </p>
      <warning>
	Putting this JAR to another location like <code>lib/ext</code> WILL
	NOT WORK.
      </warning>
      <p>
	For more on that, you can also check the 
	<jump href="http://xml.apache.org/~edwingo/jaxp-faq.html#override">

	This project's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous
	(pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. The module you wish
	to check out must be specified as the modulename. When prompted for a

      <title>Compiling the source</title>
      <p>
	At the command prompt type <code>ant test</code>. If you want to 
	use jikes instead of your default java compiler locate the <code>build.xml</code>
	file and replace the line
      </p>
      <source>&lt;property name="build.compiler" value="classic"/&gt;</source>
      <p>
	with

      <title>Testing the distibution</title>
      <p>
	The first way to ensure that everything is in place is to run the unit
	tests. This is simply done by typing <code>ant test</code>. This starts
	the included JUnit test cases. Actually, we do not have complete test
	coverage, but as a first start, it works.

	To see how the distribution works, simply run <code>ant

      <title>Where is my JCE?</title>
      <p>
	There is <em>no</em> JCE bundled together with this
	distribution. Living in Germany, I had no problem to include the JCE in
	this software package but then I realized that the Apache Project is
	hosted in the US where some export restrictions apply to the
	cryptographic primitives. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Well, how do we solve this problem? The nice guys from the <jump
	  href="ext:bouncy">Bouncy Castle</jump> where so
	helpful to supply the JAR that you need to create HMAC integrity checks
	on their web site. When you use the ant makefile <code>build.xml</code>
	and simply say <code>ant compile</code> or <code>ant get-jce</code>,
	<code>ant</code> tries to fetch this JAR from the australian
	server. After that step, the compilation works completely. 
      </p>
      <p/>
      <p>
	The ant make tools initiates an automated download of the BouncyCastle
	JCE. The file is downloaded into the libs/ directory and a "bc-" is
	prepended to the filename. This is done because we want the provider
	name (bc means BouncyCastle) being visible in the JAR's filename. 
      </p>
      <p/>
      <p>
	If you are a little paranoid like all security people and don't want
	ant to make automated downloads or your firewall doesn't permit it
	(preventing programs "phoning home"), look in the
	<code>./build.xml</code> file for the properties called
      </p>
      <p/>
      <source><![CDATA[
	<property name="jce.download.file" value="]]>&jce_download_file;<![CDATA[ />
	<property name="jce.download" 
	          value="http://www.bouncycastle.org/download/${jce.download.file}" />
	<property name="lib.jce" value="${libs}/bc-${jce.download.file}" />
	]]></source>
      <p>
	Here you can see that the file 
	<jump href="ext:java/jce/download/file">&jce_download_file;</jump>
	 is downloaded and stored in the location <code>&lib_jce;</code>
      </p>
      <p>
	If you do this by hand (pointing you favourite web browser and download
	it yourself), simply put a "<code>bc-</code>" in front of the filename
	and put it to <code>./libs/</code>, then ant won't try to make a
	download.
