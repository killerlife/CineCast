 * processing.  It is also used for xpath-filter which requires multiple list
 * comparisons.
 *
 * It is not implemented using one of the container classes as it has the
 * potential to become a real bottleneck.  It could potentially be implemented
 * as a hash list based on names of nodes (or even pointers).
